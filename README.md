# What is Burn Byte?

Burn Byte is a modern web denial of service toolkit that brings together
various types of attacks and that (in the future) will become a Botnet.
become a **watcher** to receive news and stay on top of new features

  <tr>
    <td>HTTP</td>
    <td>An HTTP flood attack is a type of volumetric <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attack designed to overwhelm a targeted server with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP requests</a>. Once the target has been saturated with requests and is unable to respond to normal traffic, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service</a> will occur for additional requests from actual users.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>ICMP</td>
    <td>A ping flood is a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service</a> attack in which the attacker attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-request packets, causing the target to become inaccessible to normal traffic. When the attack traffic comes from multiple devices, the attack becomes a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DDoS</a> or distributed denial-of-service attack.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Memcached</td>
    <td>A memcached <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to overload a targeted victim with internet traffic. The attacker <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoofs</a> requests to a vulnerable <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UDP </a>memcached* server, which then floods a targeted victim with internet traffic, potentially overwhelming the victim’s resources. While the target’s internet infrastructure is overloaded, new requests cannot be processed and regular traffic is unable to access the internet resource, resulting in .<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NTP</td>
    <td>An NTP amplification attack is a reflection-based volumetric <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attack in which an attacker exploits a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server functionality in order to overwhelm a targeted network or server with an amplified amount of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UDP</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>traffic, rendering the target and its surrounding infrastructure inaccessible to regular traffic.</td>

    <td>Ping of Death</td>
    <td>A Ping of Death attack is a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service (DoS)</a> attack in which the attacker aims to disrupt a targeted machine by sending a packet larger than the maximum allowable size, causing the target machine to freeze or crash. The original Ping of Death attack is less common today. A related attack known as an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/ddos/ping-icmp-flood-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICMP flood attack</a> is more prevalent.</td>

    <td>Slowloris is a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service</a> attack program which allows an attacker to overwhelm a targeted server by opening and maintaining many simultaneous <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP </a>connections between the attacker and the target.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Syn</td>
    <td>A SYN flood (half-open attack) is a type of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a> which aims to make a server unavailable to legitimate traffic by consuming all available server resources. By repeatedly sending initial connection request (SYN) packets, the attacker is able to overwhelm all available ports on a targeted server machine, causing the targeted device to respond to legitimate traffic sluggishly or not at all.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Udp</td>
    <td>A UDP flood is a type of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denial-of-service</a> attack in which a large number of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</a> packets are sent to a targeted server with the aim of overwhelming that device’s ability to process and respond. The <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/security/what-is-a-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firewall</a> protecting the targeted server can also become exhausted as a result of UDP flooding, resulting in a denial-of-service to legitimate traffic.</td>
